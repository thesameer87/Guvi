Problem Statement: Eco-Friendly Transport Sharing Platflorm

The increasing reliance on private vehicles has led to a significant rise in carbon emissions, contributing to climate change and environmental degradation. The need for sustainable transportation solutions is more urgent than ever.

Key problems:

1.	High carbon footprint: The use of private vehicles, particularly cars, generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions.

2.	Traffic congestion: Increased car ownership and usage contribute to traffic congestion, leading to wasted time and fuel consumption.

3.	Inefficient resource utilization: Private vehicles are often underutilized, leading to inefficient use of resources.

4.	Lack of accessible and affordable transportation options: Many individuals, especially in urban areas, lack access to reliable and affordable public transportation.


Addressing the problem:

An eco-friendly transport sharing platform can address these challenges by:

•	Reducing carbon emissions: By encouraging the sharing of bikes, electric scooters, and carpooling, the platform can significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the road and decrease overall carbon emissions.

•	Alleviating traffic congestion: Sharing transportation options can help reduce traffic congestion, leading to improved travel times and reduced fuel consumption.

•	Promoting efficient resource utilization: The platform can foster the efficient use of transportation resources by connecting individuals who need transportation with those who have excess capacity.

•	Providing accessible and affordable transportation options: By offering affordable and convenient sharing options, the platform can provide accessible transportation alternatives for individuals who may not have access to other options.

By addressing these problems, the eco-friendly transport sharing platform can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system.
